            <h3 class="recipe_lower_title">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="recipe_ingredients">
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
                <li>½ cup white wine</li>
                <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="recipe_lower_title">Steps</h3>
            <ol class="recipe_steps">
                <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour
                    and shake off any excess.
                </li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium,
                    and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
                </li>
                <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30
                    seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden
                    spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to
                    form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce
                    spooned over the top.
                </li>
            </ol>
