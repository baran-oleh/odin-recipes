            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Extra tender, extra flavorful ribs, bursting with barbeque flavor.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2½ pounds pork spareribs</li>
                <li>2 (18 ounce) bottles barbeque sauce</li>
                <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place spareribs in a large stock pot with barbeque sauce, onion, salt, and pepper. Pour in enough
                    water to cover. Bring to a low boil, and cook approximately 40 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat grill for high heat.</li>
                <li>Lightly oil grate. Remove spareribs from the stock pot, and place on the prepared grill. Use the
                    barbeque sauce in the saucepan to baste ribs while cooking. Grill ribs, basting and turning
                    frequently, for 20 minutes, or until nicely browned.
